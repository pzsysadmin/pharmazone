Email Signature Design Requirement
Objective:
To design an email signature that is professional, responsive, and consistent across desktop and mobile email clients, adhering to the following specifications.

Design Elements
Font Styles:

Use the HurmeGeometricSans1-Bold font for the name.
Use the HurmeGeometricSans1-Regular font for all other text.
Fallback Fonts: Verdana,Trebuchet MS
Ensure font sizes are visually proportional:
Name: 24px (desktop), 18px (mobile).
Title: 18px (desktop), 14px (mobile).
Contact Information: 14px (desktop), 12px (mobile).
Layout:

Desktop View:
Content (name, title, contact information) on the left.
Logo on the right.
Mobile View:
Logo should move to the left.
Content should appear on the right, aligned for readability.
Background and Borders:

Background color: White (#ffffff).
Border: 1px solid with a dark green tone (#004c3f).
Rounded corners: Apply a 15px border radius to the entire signature container.
Spacing and Alignment:

Adequate spacing between elements to avoid a cluttered appearance.
Ensure equal vertical and horizontal padding (desktop: 20px, mobile: 15px).
Dynamic Mobile Number Placeholder:

The Mobile Number (M:) should dynamically appear only if the placeholder (%%MobileNumber%%) has data.
If %%MobileNumber%% is empty or not provided, the M: label and the corresponding line should be omitted entirely.
Code Blocks for Compatibility:

The signature code must be split into two blocks to ensure compatibility with different email clients:
Block 1: Inline styles and inline fonts for Outlook 2013 (which doesnâ€™t support external CSS styles).
Block 2: Standard HTML code with linked fonts and styles for modern email viewers.
Use conditional comments or logic to serve the appropriate block to each client.
Technical Considerations
Email Client Compatibility:

Ensure compatibility with popular email clients:
Outlook (2013, 2016, 2019, and Office 365).
Gmail (web and mobile).
Apple Mail.
Other modern email clients.
Use inline styles for older Outlook versions and linked styles for modern email clients.
Font Hosting:

Fonts are hosted externally on GitHub at the following URLs:

Logo:

Logo URL: https://pzsysadmin.github.io/pharmazone/Pharmazone_Logo_Icon.png.
Dimensions:
Desktop: Maximum width 100px.
Mobile: Maximum width 80px.
Responsiveness:

Use a @media query to optimize the design for smaller screens:
Stack elements vertically for readability.
Center align the text if necessary for clarity.
Dynamic Placeholder Example
The M: %%MobileNumber%% should behave as follows:

If %%MobileNumber%% contains a value (e.g., +965 555 111 22):
M: +965 555 111 22
If %%MobileNumber%% is empty or missing:
Omit the line entirely. No M: label or blank space should appear in the signature.
Deliverables
A responsive HTML file implementing the email signature design.
The signature code split into two blocks:
Block 1: Inline styles and inline fonts for Outlook 2013.
Block 2: Standard HTML with linked fonts and CSS for modern email viewers.
A preview of the signature on both desktop and mobile views.
Ensure the code is tested and verified for:
Font rendering.
Compatibility across major email clients.
Proper handling of the %%MobileNumber%% placeholder.


Make sure the characters not exceed 5000 in the file
